		<p>Two-Face (Harvey Dent) is a supervillain appearing in comic books published by DC Comics, commonly as an adversary of the superhero Batman. The character was created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger and first appeared in Detective Comics #66 (August 1942).[3] As one of Batman's most enduring enemies, Two-Face belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up Batman's rogues gallery.</p>
		<p>Once a bright and upstanding district attorney of Gotham City dedictated to ridding its streets of crime and corruption, Harvey Dent is hideously scarred on the left side of his face after mob boss Sal Maroni throws acidic chemicals at him during a court trial. He subsequently goes insane and adopts the "Two-Face" persona, becoming a criminal obsessed with the number two, the concept of duality, and the conflict between good and evil. In later years, writers have portrayed Harvey Dent as having dissociative identity disorder, with Two-Face being an alter, which stemmed from the abuse he received from his father during his childhood. Two-Face obsessively makes all important decisions by flipping a two-headed coin, with the other half scarred, given to him by his father. The modern version is established as having once been a personal friend and ally of James Gordon and Batman, as well as the childhood best friend of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne.</p>
		<p>Two-Face has no superpowers, instead relying on his proficiency in marksmanship and hand-to-hand combat, which was further improved after being trained by Deathstroke and Batman. As a former lawyer, the character uses his expertise in criminal law, criminology, and police procedures to devise his crimes.</p>
		<p>The character has been adapted into numerous forms of media, having been portrayed in live action by Billy Dee Williams in the 1989 film Batman, Tommy Lee Jones in the 1995 film Batman Forever, Aaron Eckhart in 2008 film The Dark Knight, and Nicholas D'Agosto on the FOX television series Gotham. Richard Moll, Troy Baker, and others have provided Two-Face's voice ranging from animation to video games.</p>
